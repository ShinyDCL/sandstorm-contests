# Decentraland scene

This project contains all of my submissions for Sandstorm's Decentraland contests.

## 3D models

All of the 3D models have been created by me, with the exception of default grass and Github and Twitter links, which are from Decentraland Builder.
Textures used in 3D models and their sources:

- Color palette from Decentraland builder
- Some simpler textures (for example, gradient colors) have been created by me using Inkscape (free and open-source vector graphics editor).
- ambientCG, all ambientCG assets are under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal License. <a href="https://docs.ambientcg.com/books/website-licensing/page/license-information">License information</a>. For some textures I have edited color to be more suitable for my work.
- Generated using <a href="https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/">DreamStudio AI</a>

## Try it out

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

**Previewing the scene**

Open this folder on the command line, then run:

```
dcl start
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI opens the scene in a new browser tab.

## Deploy to Decentraland

If you own any parcels of land in Decentraland, or have permissions to deploy to someone else's, you can publish this project.

1. Make sure the scene parcels in `scene.json` match those you own or have permissions on.
2. Run `dcl deploy` on the project folder
3. This will open a browser tab to confirm. Metamask will prompt you to sign.
   > Note: Make sure you are using the wallet that owns the parcels or has permissions.

### Deploy to a free server

If you don't own parcels in Decentraland or are not ready to publish your scene to the world, you can share your creations by uploading your scenes to a free hosting service.

See [Upload a preview](https://docs.decentraland.org/development-guide/deploy-to-now/) for instructions on how to do this.
